        Decision Suport System for detecting the Ripeness of Melons Fruit. This App is a master degree project that aims to develop a system for detecting the correct harvest time. The farmers currently harvest melons based on their experience, and melon cannot maintain their quality after harvesting. Thus, the melon needs to be harvested at the right time that will not affect the maturity of the fruit harvested earlier. Melon harvesting is a daily task; Melon is not mature on the same day even though the melon plant is planted in the same period due to genetics and environment. The decision support system should detect and classify the ripeness level of the fruit on the tree. The system will categorize the maturity level into three categories: Ripe, About to Ripe, or Under Ripe (within a rate from 0 to 10 obtained from fuzzy inference system result). The ripeness levels are confirmed by the expert, depending on the skin color of the fruit. As a result, we get 100% accuracy in classifying each category using phone camera images and video. Furthermore, this decision support system can be implemented in melonâ€™s harvesting robot. The melon used in this study is honeydew Cucumis melo L, var. Alisha F1.
